The base URL and search term are given as input to the API which returns a list of links in the website domain that contain the search term. The results are stored in an AWS DynamoDb table.

Requirements: The requirements are specified in the requirement.txt file.All the libraries can be installed using in python3. In addition, aws credentials need to be configured for the environment.
The api is run using the Uvicorn server and can be started using this command:
